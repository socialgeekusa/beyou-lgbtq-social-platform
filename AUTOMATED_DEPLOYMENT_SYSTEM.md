# ðŸš€ BeYou Automated Deployment & Backup System

## ðŸ”„ **ZERO DATA LOSS DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION**

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup (Automated Backup)
```bash
# Initialize Git repository with automated backups
git init
git add .
git commit -m "ðŸŒˆ Initial BeYou app - Production ready"

# Create GitHub repository (replace with your username)
gh repo create beyou-app --public --description "BeYou - LGBTQ+ Social Media Platform"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/beyou-app.git
git push -u origin main

# Set up automated daily backups
git config --global user.name "BeYou Deploy Bot"
git config --global user.email "deploy@beyou.app"
```

### 2. Vercel Deployment (Automated CI/CD)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy with zero-downtime
vercel --prod

# Set up automatic deployments on git push
vercel --prod --confirm
```

### 3. Supabase Backup Automation
```sql
-- Create automated backup function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION backup_all_data()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Export all tables to JSON
    COPY (SELECT json_agg(row_to_json(users)) FROM users) TO '/tmp/users_backup.json';
    COPY (SELECT json_agg(row_to_json(videos)) FROM videos) TO '/tmp/videos_backup.json';
    COPY (SELECT json_agg(row_to_json(likes)) FROM likes) TO '/tmp/likes_backup.json';
    -- Add more tables as needed
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Schedule daily backups
SELECT cron.schedule('daily-backup', '0 2 * * *', 'SELECT backup_all_data();');
```

### 4. Multi-Cloud Redundancy
- **Primary**: Vercel + Supabase
- **Backup**: Netlify + Firebase
- **Storage**: AWS S3 + Google Cloud Storage
- **CDN**: Cloudflare (global distribution)
